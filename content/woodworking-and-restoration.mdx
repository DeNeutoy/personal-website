## Mid Century Modern Chairs

I got these chairs from Buy Nothing in pretty bad shape. I sanded and refinished them, and reupholstered the seats.

## Coffee Table

My most successful woodworking project was this coffee table. I got the live edge maple from Ballard Reuse for $120. I used a router to cut the tile insets, and then used some bowties to stabilize the splits in the table. It's stained 3 times with a water base polyurethane varnish, but no other finish.

_The process of making the coffee table. 1) The original piece of live edge maple I got from Ballard Reuse. 2) The bathroom tiles I chose to inset into the table. 3) The table after I had used a router to cut the tile insets. 4) The bowties I used to stabilize the splits in the table._

## Entryway Table

I made this side table from a salvaged piece of butcher block that I found on the side of the road. It's currently our entryway table, hence the cutout design. I was practising using a router for the edges, and it turned out pretty well.

## Dining Table

The largest piece i've made so far - this is impressive to look at, but not hugely practical as a dining table, because I made the mistake of buying a softwood (elm). I've since learned that elm is not a good choice for furniture, because it's too soft and doesn't hold up well over time - the table top is soft enough to mark with a nail, and even 3 coats of polyurethane varnish doesn't harden it up enough.
