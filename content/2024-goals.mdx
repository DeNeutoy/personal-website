My goals for 2024.

### Health

1. **Lose 20lbs.** I'm overweight, and I need to be more concious of how I eat. Starting weight: 233lbs.
2. **Only eat bread that I make, or is obviously hand-made.** My ability to eat carbohydrates is unbounded, and having an arbitrary rule like this will probably:
    - Help me lose some weight
    - Make me eat nicer bread that I enjoy more on average
3. **Increase my 1 rep max powerclean to my bodyweight.** I *love* powercleans as an exercise. My current clean is 170lbs, so this should be achievable, particularly when combined with bullet 1.
4. **Cold plunge/swim outside at least bi-weekly.** It's great for my mental health and it's so easy to achieve.
5. **Dry January and Sober September** (I made this one up, but it's alliterative so it's legit).

### Life

1. **Write at least 1 article per month on this blog.** I enjoy writing, and it makes my thoughts clearer when I write things down.
2. **Cook for people in a slightly more formal setting than dinner parties.** Hopefully start this via an idea I have for a supper club - [The Albion Supper Club](https://www.albionsupperclub.com/).
3. Finish my van conversion to a higher standard than it is currently. I skimped on various pieces, and some bits need finishing.
    - Wrap the door inserts in fabric.
    - Re-finish the benches with nicer plywood.
    - Paint the roof panels.
4. **Use social media less.** Replace this with writing and reading.
5. **Read 20 books.** Tracking at [books 2024](https://markneumann.xyz/blog/books-2024). 

### Work

1. **Explore JAX.** It seems like the future of high performance computation.
2. **Do more pair programming.** I enjoy this, and i've done it successfully only a few times. 
3. **Make more static visualizations.** I enjoy doing these, and I haven't done one for a while.
    - A follow up to my [NHS visualization](https://deneutoy.github.io/savethenhs/), around the effects of COVID.
    - T-SNE visualizations of some preference finetuning datasets.
