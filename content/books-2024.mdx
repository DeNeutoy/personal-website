#### [Edible Economics: A Hungry Economist Explains the World](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61030740), Ha-Joon Chang 

Covers some basic economic ideas in a fun way. It's a bit scatty, but some of the sections were interesting - particularly the impact of Limited companies at the time of the East India Trading Company, and some of the forward looking economic policy at the end of the book.
