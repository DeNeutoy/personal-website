#### [Edible Economics: A Hungry Economist Explains the World](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61030740), Ha-Joon Chang 

Covers some basic economic ideas in a fun way. It's a bit scatty, but some of the sections were interesting - particularly the impact of Limited companies at the time of the East India Trading Company, and some of the forward looking economic policy at the end of the book.


#### [Sedated: How Modern Capitalism Created Our Mental Health Crisis](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57751566), James Davies

One of the worst non-fiction books I have read in recent memory, specific critques:

- Extremely sensationalist writing style, with a clear political opinion underlying the reasonable medical evidence. In particular, he takes issue with all forms of measurement of mental health outcomes under New Labour and the Conservative governments, but doesn't offer any alternative. 
- Bad/lazy mis-representation of the prescription of Thalidomide as an anti-depression/anxiety drug. It was prescribed primarily as a morning sickness medication, and drawing parallels to existing anti-depressants is not a reasonable comparison.
- Repeatedly makes the argument that situational depression and anxiety is common and resolves itself untreated when people change their situation. This is true, but doesn't make the case for non-medicinal intervention, as a key reason why people cannot navigate their way out of difficult situations is because of either the depression or anxiety they are experiencing. This is a big reason, in my opinion, for the stabilizing effect of medical interventions.

I did find the section on the history of the DSM and the development of the diagnostic criteria for mental health conditions interesting, but it was a small part of the book.


#### [Jews Don't Count](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52710961-jews-don-t-count), David Baddiel

Good read, surprising light writing style for the subject matter. I think the book is a bit too short, and could have done with a bit more depth in the arguments. The amount of the discussion centered around Twitter is a bit exhausting. Sometimes Baddiel makes some crude references which undermine the core arguments (e.g "being able to tell who was Jewish in a sauna"), but other points, such as the difference in semantics of Jew  (descriptive noun, often offensive) vs Jewish (standard adjective), and the distinction between ethnicity and religion are informative.
